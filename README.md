# Prestige-Rating
# Perform Multiple Linear Regression
## Project Overview
Prestige is a widespread respect and admiration felt for someone or something based on a perception of their achievements or quality. Hence, this project focused on the impact of the income, education, and women on the prestige. To understand these relationships, I applied a multiple linear regression analysis via R, and Jupyter Notebook. </br>
I used the Prestige dataset that consists of 102 observations with 6 variables. This dataset is publicly available and can be accessed from the following [Link](http://socserv.socsci.mcmaster.ca/jfox/books/Companion/data/Prestige.txt). </br>

The description of the dataset variables are as follows:
- education: 
The average number of years of education for occupational incumbents.
- income: 
The average income of occupational incumbents, in dollars.
- women: 
The percentage of women in the occupation.
- prestige:
The average prestige rating for the occupation.
- census: 
The code of the occupation used in the survey.
- type: 
Professional and managerial(prof), white collar(wc), blue collar(bc), or missing (NA) (Fox and Weisberg 2011) </br>
